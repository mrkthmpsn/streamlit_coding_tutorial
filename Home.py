    Coding can be a pain. But I'm convinced that it shouldn't be as hard as it is to get into it. 
    This site will have tutorials aimed at getting you started coding in Python, with two aims:
    1) That you'll learn useful foundational coding skills which have broad uses
    2) That you'll actually get something interesting while you learn (each tutorial ends up with you having some data 
    that isn't easy to get via the FBref site itself)
    
    The data will primarily come from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/), because it's a great source of stats and it 
    openly provides you with the option to get (small parts of) its data. Right there, right on the site, for free!
    
    You can run the code in these tutorials online in places like [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) 
    or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), meaning you don't have to worry about downloading anything. 
    There's a post about these options, and a walkthrough of how to get data from FBref into a csv file here: [LINK to the other page]
    
    The tutorials don't _have_ to be done in order, although it might be helpful. They're short, so you can whizz 
    right through. 
    
    Enjoy! And please get in touch with any comments, questions, or complaints.
