    I'll be honest, coding can be a pain. But I'm convinced that it shouldn't be. 
    
    This site will have tutorials aimed at getting you started coding in Python, with two aims:
    1) That you'll learn useful foundational coding skills which have broad uses
    2) That you'll actually get something interesting while you learn (each tutorial ends up with you having some data 
    that isn't easy to get via the FBref site itself)
    
    The data will primarily come from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/), because it's a great source of stats and is easy
    to get (small* but useful) bits of data from. Right there, right on the site, for free! _*I'm only saying 'small' 
    so that the data provider doesn't get worried you'll all try and set up full databases with all their data_
    
    You can run the code in these tutorials online in places like [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) 
    or [Noteable](https://app.noteable.io), meaning you don't have to worry about downloading anything. 
    There's a post about these options, and a [walk-through of how to get data from FBref into a csv file here](https://mrkthmpsn-streamlit-coding-tutorial-home-wk3wn4.streamlit.app/Getting_data_from_fbref_and_IDEs).
    
    The tutorials don't _have_ to be done in order, although it might be helpful. They're short, so you can whizz 
    right through. [There are plans to add more if these first two prove to be useful]. 
    
    Enjoy! And please get in touch with any comments, questions, or complaints.
